## 1.	Introduction to the Project
This project is basically based on the online book system of International Institute of Professional Studies, DAVV, Indore. The main aim of this project is to provide all the course related book in the form of PDF. So, it will be easy for student to search course related books online and download it easily.
Overall this project  will be developed to help the students as well as staff of library to maintain the books  in the best way possible and also reduce the wastage of time in searching books on different sites.

## 2.	Existing System
In existing system, the official site of IIPS does not have any books in its record .If any student need books, then they have to search  it on different sites whereas the official site has separate portion for the books but it is null. Searching for books on different sites is time consuming and sometimes the book  is also not available on some sites, because they are available on specific sites only. So it is very hectic for the students to search books on different sites.

## 3.	Problem Statement
The current system will have all the required course related books on a single platform and it will be much easier for the student to search, read or download book. . The availability and updating of books is insured by authorized  admin .This project will provide authorization of every student on the database of IIPS. This project will be deployed on IIPS official site further. Since for starting phase this is for IIPS only, but this problem of book is faced by many collages. So, we can manage the books of different collages too.
